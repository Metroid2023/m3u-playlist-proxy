# What is the M3U Playlist Proxy

The M3U Playlist Proxy is a lightweight and efficient solution that forwards essential headers to proxy M3U playlist streams. Acting as an intermediary between your client and the server, it ensures that critical headers (such as User-Agent, Referer, etc.) are correctly forwarded. This process enables IPTV applications to seamlessly access streams that require specific headers to be present.
